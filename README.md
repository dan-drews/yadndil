# yadndil
Yet Another Dot Net Dependency Injection Library

## Purpose
Yadndil is a project that I started for educational purposes. Chances are pretty good that I won't maintain it for very long, but I'm open to suggestions and pull requests on it. I started it to understand how a DI library could work theoretically. I haven't referenced any other implementations, but if feature ideas come in, or if I extend the features on it, I may do so.
